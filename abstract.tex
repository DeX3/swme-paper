\section{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

Continuous Integration has established itself as a popular term in modern-day
software development. In this paper, we describe its core-concepts so that the
uninformed reader may grasp its essential features. Furthermore, we discuss
several existing solutions for implementing CI in a real-world environment and
describe vital parts of the Continuous Integration workflow such as various GIT
branching models.
