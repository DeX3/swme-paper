\section{Git-workflows}\label{sec:Git-workflows}

Because the way we use our version control management, influences the way continous integration works, we want to depict different approaches.

\subsection{Centralized Workflow}\label{sec:Centralized Workflow}
This workflow does not require any other branches beside \textit{master}. It uses a central repository to serve as a single point-of-entry for all changes to the project.
When a developer wants to commit his changes, he pushes them to the master branch. In case of a conflict the developer has to fetch the updates of the other developers first.
After that the developer is up-to-date and can now commit his changes, this style results into a perfect linear history of changes.
A rebase prevents big merge-commits, it tries to merge commit by commit, which results in less conflicts and an easier way to see when bugs got introduced.
This usage of Git resembls the classic SVN the most and makes transitioning between those two systems the easiest. \\
